## by (Mohamed Abdalla)


## Dataset

> first of all speaking about data set elements i choosed #Ford GoBike System Data " baywheels-data " which generated in 2020 our data compet from 13 columns and each one explains one constsntly elemnt about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
and my mainly jop for this dataset is clean and preparing it for nice visualization


## Summary of Findings

> the data we have structures as  158168 row and 13 columns 
> "rideable_type" and "member_casual" both columns has one or more type which we can classified each one of them with its count and visualzie them beautifully side by side to know which type for each columns are incresed and which one is decresed in visualization!

> 1- the differnce between start time and end timd was had better to count the difference to facilitate a bunch of code editing to count the difference between 
> 2- start lat and end lat were supposed to edited like the comment i wrote above!


## Key Insights for Presentation

> first we plotted the relationship between start_station_id and end_station_id and that plot explains the distripution between them in visualization

###### we also explains that for each type of them we explaining which day has the most bike count and which one is less bike count per hour
###### we also explains that for each type of them we explaining which day has the most bike count and which one is less bike count per month


##### the bike usage per month for electric_bike incresed to 17500 on saterday which unlike thuresdat that has the least bike count
###### in the docked_bike portion we saw that saterday has the most bike count and it's up to 8000 unlike thuresday alse the other one
